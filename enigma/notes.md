<h1>Simulation of an Enigma Machine</h1>

<h2>Design of the Enigma Machine</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A combination of mechanical and electrical subsystems</li>
  <li>
    Mechanical Subsystems:
    <ul>
      <li>A keyboard</li>
      <li>A set of rotating disks called <em>rotors</em></li>
      <li>A <em>spindle</em> along which the rotors are arranged</li>
      <li>A stepping component which rotates the rotors each time a
          key is pressed</li>
      <li>A series of lights, one for each letter</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  	Electrical Subsystem:
    <ul>
      <li>The mechanical parts form a varying electrical circuit. This is
          achieved by the rotation of the rotors. Each time a rotor
          is rotated, a new electrical circuit is created.</li>
      <li>Each key is connected to a unique electrical circuit, and this
          pathway is changed upon each key press.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
